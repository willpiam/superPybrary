# superPybrary
A super library written in python? What does it do? You should be asking "What doesn't it do?"
(adding this line then merging this file to ensure I know how to update from the terminal)

How to use this libery:
1. make sure you have the files (pybrary.py) along side your program 
2. in your program (at the top) use the line ---->    import pybrary
3. to use a specific function here is how you call it (an example)-------->      pybrary.bubble(lst)

in step three you are calling the function bubble from inside the pybrary libery and giving it the value lst (which in the tester program is a usless list of numbers)


Notes to developers (Including myself):
-when adding new functions you can utalize other functions inside your new one


included fuctions:

bubble
shuffle
isDecending
